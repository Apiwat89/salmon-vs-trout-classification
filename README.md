# salmon-vs-trout-classification
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify images of two fish species: Salmon and Trout. The model takes input images and predicts whether the fish shown is a Salmon or a Trout.

Try it out via Google Colab and post it on GitHub later.

This project was conducted during the 3rd semester of the 1st year of study at King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok.
